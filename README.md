Hi! Nice to meet you. This is a document may help us start our course.

## My goal
I'm preparing for an interview of applying the school of **Modern and Contemporary Literature**, which contains an English oral test.

## My plan for our course
1. I'm a beginner to English speaking, so we can start from simple daily talks.
2. When I can speak more English (perhaps after a few classes), we can focus on the interview:
   + You can teach me some common and useful English expression about **Modern and Contemporary Literature**.
   + You can play the role of the professor in the interview, asking me possible questions (about professional knowledge or personal situation) 

## Bonus: Learn to correctly pronounce the following self-introduction
&emsp;&emsp;"Good afternoon/morning, teachers. It is my great honor to participate in today's interview. My name is Honoka, and I come from XXX, XXX Province. I graduated from XXX University, where I focused on my studies and received a scholarship for academic excellence. I also obtained certificates for English Level 3, Mandarin, and computer proficiency. After graduation, I started working and also enrolled in the self-study undergraduate program at XXX University, which I expect to complete in June 2024. In order to further improve myself, I have decided to continue my studies and pursue a master's degree. Based on my long-standing interest in literature, I have chosen to apply for your school's modern and contemporary literature program.  
&emsp;&emsp;In terms of domestic literature, I prefer science fiction and realism works, such as Liu Cixin's "The Three-Body Problem", "Ball Lightning", "Supporting Mankind" and Yu Hua's Mo Yan Lu Yao's works.  
&emsp;&emsp;If I am fortunate enough to be admitted as a graduate student at your esteemed institution, I will diligently follow the plan below: I will study both professional and public courses with dedication, make use of my spare time to read extensively, expand my professional knowledge reserves, and build a knowledge framework to lay a solid foundation for future in-depth research.  
&emsp;&emsp;The above is my personal introduction, I hope you will criticize and correct thank you!"
