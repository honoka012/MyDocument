Hi! Nice to meet you. This is a document may help us start our course.

## My goal
I'm preparing for an interview of applying the school of literature, which contains an English oral test.

## My plan for our course
1. I'm a beginner to English speaking, so we can start from simple daily talks.
2. When I can speak more English (perhaps after a few classes), we can focus on the interview:
   + You can teach me some common and useful English expression about literature.
   + You can play the role of the professor in the interview, asking me possible questions (about professional knowledge or personal situation)
